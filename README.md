# Mary Antonette Tanael's info page  📄🖋️💻✨
Hey, it's Mary! I'm a technical writer and editor based in the Philippines.

I created this site so that I have a place to dump all important links, including links to my socials, online CV, and portfolio. I've included a short bio page, too. I plan to forward this page to future employers and clients. But most of all, this is just me playing around with GitHub pages and having a blast with it.
