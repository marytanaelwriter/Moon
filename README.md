# Mary Antonette Tanael's info page  📄🖋️💻✨
Hey, it's Mary! I'm a technical writer and editor based in the Philippines.

I created this site because I wanted to have a place where I could dump important links, such as links to my socials, online CV, and portfolio. I've also included a short bio page for those who want to learn more about me, including future employers and clients. But most importantly, this is just me playing around with GitHub pages and having a blast with it.
