<center>👩🏻‍💻</center>

Hey, my name is Mary Antonette Tanael. You can call me "Mary" for short (although my close friends know that I go by several other nicknames).

I'm a writer and editor based in Laguna, Philippines. I hold a BA in Creative Writing from UP Diliman.

After graduating, I got into content writing and copywriting. I did that for a few years--until it felt tedious and soul-sucking. I desperately wanted something new.

During my soul searching, I discovered technical writing. And it was like a whole new world of opportunities opened up before me. This field married my passion for clear, concise, and helpful writing with learning new things--especially techie things like software and web applications.

I'm currently seeking full-time tech writing opportunities in the IT industry. In my free time, I try to learn coding and work on my personal blog. When I'm not busy with my passion projects, I'm probably reading, listening to podcasts, or taking long walks.
